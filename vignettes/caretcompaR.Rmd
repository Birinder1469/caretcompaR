#Using caretcompaR

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


An R package facilitating beautifully efficient comparisons of machine learning classifiers and models.

caretcompaR harnesses the power of caret, combining it with R dataframes for easy, breezy, and beautiful machine learning regressors and classifiers exploration.

Example Usage : 


```{r}

#Loading in the data and splitting it into an X dataframe of features and a y 'Target' vector.
X <- iris[,1:4]
y <- iris$Species

head(X)
head(y)
```

```{r}
#Splitting data into a training set, a validation set, a combined training and validation set, as well as a test set. 
# The split will be 40% training, 30% validation, and 30% test.

glorious_datasets <- caretcompaR::split(X, y, 0.4, 0.3, 0.3)

#' Resulting dataframes are sorted in a list in this order: 
#' 1. X_train , 
#' 2. y_train , 
#' 3. X_validation , 
#' 4. y_validation , 
#' 5. X_train_validation , 
#' 6. y_train_validation , 
#' 7. X_test , 
#' 8. y_test .

#Assigning our freshly split datasets so we can run some machine learning models
X_train <- glorious_datasets[[1]]
y_train <- glorious_datasets[[2]]

X_test <- glorious_datasets[[7]]
y_test <- glorious_datasets[[8]]

#Let's try these classifiers
models <- c('svmPoly','knn','rf')

#Running our chosen models on our data and building a beautiful summary
results_df <- caretcompaR::train_test_acc_time(models,X_train,y_train$target,X_test,y_test$target)

#Let's see how we did in terms of train accuracy, test accuracy, and timing
results_df
```

```{r}
#Now let's also take a look at some plots to compare our models
# Plot the accuracy of the models 
caretcompaR::comparison_viz(results_df,'accuracy')
#!["Accuracy"](vignettes/accuracy.png)
```


```{r}
# Plot the timing of the models 
caretcompaR::comparison_viz(results_df,'time')
#!["Time"](vignettes/time.png)

```
